### 🧑🏻‍💻 Command Line Environment

As a developer we use the command line/terminal significantly during development. The knowledge of basic commands and familiarity with command line interface(CLI) will help you in the journey ahead.

### 🎓 Topics to learn
- Basic terminal commands
    - `cd` - Move around your directory structure
    - `mkdir` - Create directories
    - `touch` - Create or modify files
    - `ls` - List the contents of the directory or file
    - `rm` - Delete directories or files
    
- Navigation 
    - Follow this simple activity to learn how to navigate through the command line.
    > - Make a directory with your **Name** using `mkdir`
    > - Move to the directory using `cd`
    > - Create a text file *About* using `touch`
    > - Create a directory *Projects* using `mkdir`
    > - List of the contents of the current directory using `ls`. You will see **About.txt** and **Projects**
    > - Delete **About** and **Projects** using `rm`

### 🌴 Version Control

Even if you haven't heard of version control you might be aware of `Git` and `GitHub`. Often times developers collaborate to work on projects, `Version Control` allows developers to track changes made to their codebase over time and collaborate effectively with other team members.

### 🎓 Topics to learn
- Git terminologies and concept
    - Commits
    - Staging
    - Branching
- GitHub 
    - Forking a Repository
    - Cloning a Repository
    - Pull Requests and Merging

### 🖥️ Code Editors
A best-fit code editor will make any developer more efficient at writing code. It will assist to examine code for less mistakes and show where edits need to be made. 

### 🔖 Advantages
- `Code formatting` - It will make your code more readable by automatically adding proper indentation.
- `Intellisense` - It helps you write code faster by suggesting the next line or keyword in your code.
- `Git Integration` - In-built integration to help you perform staging, commits and other git functions
- `Plugins and Features` - The code editors provide a large variety of plugins and extensions to enhance your development process

### 🖥️ Editors

You can choose an editor of your choice. These are the most commonly used code editors:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - A light-weight editor by microsoft
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) - A light weight editor by Sublime HQ
