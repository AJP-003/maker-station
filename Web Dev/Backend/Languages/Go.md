## Why learn GoLang

- Go (or Golang) is a programming language designed for building fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale. Its simplicity, concurrency features, and built-in garbage collection make it particularly well-suited for building large-scale, networked applications and distributed systems. Additionally, Go's growing popularity and strong community support make it an increasingly relevant language for both web and backend development.

- Go is extensively used by google,uber,netflix,twitch,dropbox etc, go is mainly used in building api's , go is known for its extensbility in microservice architecture, lately go's popularity has been increasing so it is a very good choice to learn go.

- Go (or Golang) can be used for a variety of applications, including building web servers and APIs, creating networked and distributed systems, developing command-line tools and utilities, writing system software and device drivers, and more generally for any application that requires high performance, reliability, and scalability.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Programming Knowledge

There is no prerequesite in learning go lang , but familarity of basic programming is good

## üì≤ Installation and Setup

- Download Go: Visit the official Go website at golang.org and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

- Install Go: Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Go on your machine.

- Set up the environment variables: After installing Go, you need to set up the environment variables to ensure that Go commands can be executed from anywhere on your machine. This typically involves adding the Go installation directory to your PATH environment variable.

- Verify the installation: To verify that Go has been installed correctly, open a command prompt and run the command go version. This should display the version of Go that you have installed.

- Optional: Install a Go editor or IDE: While it's possible to write Go code in any text editor, you may want to install a specialized Go editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to take advantage of features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging.

That's it! After following these steps, you should have a working installation of Go on your machine and be ready to start writing and running Go code.
